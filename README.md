## project overview
this project aims to research and implement multi-speaker speech separation and sound source localization technology. When two people are speaking simultaneously, how to sepearate each speaker's voice from a dualchannel recording and estimate their azimuth in space.
The reason for choosing this topic is that it integrates two fields: signal processing and deep learning. On one hand, it involves classic speech signal processing methods such as STFT and time-frequency masking; on the other hand, it utilizes the deep learning framework to improve the separation performance, possessing both engineering feasibility and academic exploration value.

## research problems:
- How can deep learning methods be used to separate the signals of individual speakers from mixed speech?
- Compared with traditional methods (ICA), are deep learning models better in separation effects?
- Can dual-channel recording further assist in sound source localization and thereby enhance the practicality of the system?

## method
The STFT features of mixed speech are modeled by using the LSTM/BiLSTM network.
model input: magnitude spectrogram of mixed speech
output: time-frequency masks for each speaker
multiply the predicted mask with the mixed speech and then reconstruct the separated speech through ISTFT.
loss function: SDR/MSE

## except result
Realize the separation of voices between two speakers, the result is better than ICA baseline


## dataset:
MiniLibriMix (https://zenodo.org/records/3871592), includes dual speaker mixed voice
use dual-channel microphones to record the dialogue between two people for demonstration and testing the generalization ability of the model

## timetable:
week          	task
6–7	Literature research and download the MiniLibriMix dataset <br>
8–9	Build a MATLAB deep learning model and complete the STFT + LSTM mask prediction framework <br>
10–11	Model training and preliminary evaluation, and comparison of ICA and deep learning results <br>
12	Add the sound source location module to visualise <br>
13	final report and present video <br>
